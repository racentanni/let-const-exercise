    1. What is the difference between var and let?
        var: is redeclarable and reassignable, and exists in the global scope
        let: can be reassigned, but not redeclared. Is block scoped.
    2. What is the difference between var and const?
        var: is redecarable and reassignable, and exists in the global scope.
        const: cannot be redeclared or reassigned especially with primative value types,
               but, can be mutated with reference types (arrays, objects). Is block-scoped.    
    3. What is the difference between let and const?
        Let can be reassigned, but not redeclared. const can neither be redeclared, or reassigned.
    4. What is hoisting?
        When JS is compiled, variables are hoisted to the top of the scope before anything else.
        with var, you can declare and empty value before it's later used.
